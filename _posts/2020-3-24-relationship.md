# Does love really exist? Or is it just a hallucination?
### *it doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want soemthing else...*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We human beings want/need lots of things, home, job, sex, title, sense of value, respect from others...and maybe, love.
The question I'm interested in is : all those 'human needs', will it last? Or could it be, once we get it, we then want something else instead?
The other stuff we need them for long long time, as long as human nature stay constant, they stay too. But Love is a fleet, it's transitory, unprovable, one moment of passion, untrustworthy.
Will this last? who knows...

### Assume nothing!
kids never assume, they live moment to moment, only they know love, love only valid at that moment. That's how life works, also how human nature works.

### *we keep saying 'see you soon', but we knew we'd never see eath other again*
