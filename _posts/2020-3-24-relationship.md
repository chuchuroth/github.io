One thing I have to see positively, if in the past decade why I haven't made major progress in my career is because someone is constantly dragging me, then it probably means that I'm not a 'born' slow walker, I'm actually a fast walker which means once the dragging is stopped, then I'm on my own, then I can go as fast as I could!
